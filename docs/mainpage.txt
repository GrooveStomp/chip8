//! \mainpage Aaron Oman's CHIP-8 Emulator
//!
//! \section intro_sec Introduction
//!
//! This is my project to implement an emulator.
//!
//! I chose the CHIP-8 as it is known to be a good first emulation
//! project due to the limited specs of the described system, and
//! especially the low number (35!) of opcodes supported.

//! with the -d command line paramter:
